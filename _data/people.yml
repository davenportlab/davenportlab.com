  summary: Emma's research interests lie in applying sophisticated analytical strategies to cohorts of patients to improve the treatment of disease. She focuses on integrating functional genomics and clinical data in order to understand how genetics contributes to the patient-to-patient heterogeneity in treatment response. Emma completed her PhD research in 2014 under the supervision of Professor Julian Knight at the University of Oxford. In 2015, she joined Professor Soumya Raychaudhuri's lab at Harvard Medical School as a postdoctoral research fellow. Emma joined the Human Genetics Programme at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in October 2018.

  summary: Elena combines her expertise in molecular and cellular biology with -omics analysis to study how individual genetic variants contribute to disease susceptibility and progression. She obtained her PhD in Molecular Biology from Humboldt University, Berlin and conducted postdoctoral research at the Max-Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin. Elena was a scientific database curator at EMBL-EBI before joining the group in 2019 as a Janet Thornton postdoctoral fellow.

  summary: Katie's work investigates variation in the host immune response and its potential relevance in clinical decision making and drug development. She is particularly interested in how the genetic background of a patient can impact their disease progression and response to treatment. Katie obtained her PhD in Clinical Medicine at the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics in Professor Julian Knight's lab and joined the group as a postdoctoral fellow in 2019.
