  summary: Emma's research interests lie in applying sophisticated analytical strategies to cohorts of patients to improve the treatment of disease. She focuses on integrating functional genomics and clinical data in order to understand how genetics contributes to the patient-to-patient heterogeneity in treatment response. Emma completed her PhD research in 2014 under the supervision of Professor Julian Knight at the University of Oxford. In 2015, she joined Professor Soumya Raychaudhuri's lab at Harvard Medical School as a postdoctoral research fellow. Her PhD and postdoctoral research have given her a strong foundation in computational methods, wet lab molecular biology and data acquisition.
