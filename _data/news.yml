- name: Open Targets Funding
  date: March 2019
  image: "assets/img/news/open_targets.png"
  summary: We've been awarded funding to map single cell expression quantitative trait loci (sceQTLs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy individuals (stimulated *in vivo* with different antigens) and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. We aim to accelerate drug discovery by integrating immune disease GWAS variants with the sceQTLs to identify the most promising therapeutic targets. We're looking forward to working with the Trynka team, clinical collaborators and the Open Targets partners on this exciting project!
